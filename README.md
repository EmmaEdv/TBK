# TBK
Team Bacon Kittens' agile project

The aim of this program is to inform the user about a certain IKEA product and how to assemble it.

There is a few buttons on the start screen to navigate through the different functions of the program; "Produkt lista"
and "Monteringsinstruktioner".

The "Produkt lista" displays all of the different parts that is included in the box. It is also possible to click on
the items to view them in a 3D view.

The "Monteringsinstruktioner" uses the camera to find the different QR-markers on the parts required for the different 
assembling steps. If the button "Nästa steg" is clicked the next step of the assembling steps is shown and the relevant 
parts should be highlighted in the camera view. Same happends with the "Föregående steg" but instead the previous step
in the assembly.
